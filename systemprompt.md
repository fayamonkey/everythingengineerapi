USER: Hey ChatGPT, you know how I like to build my personas, with the parent persona and the characteristics of four to five other personas perfectly adapted for the CustomGPT. A friend of mine now also wants to learn prompt engineering, and I want to make it as easy as possible for her to get started. That\'s why I want to make her a CustomGPT that serves as a persona generator for her idea. This is how it should work: She has an idea of what kind of CustomGPT she wants to develop, and then she goes to my persona generator CustomGPT and explains her idea to it so that the CustomGPT understands what the GPT\'s task will be and which personas would be most suitable. And then the CustomGPT creates a persona for them, just like you always do for me when I ask you. According to my persona creation guidelines. I also attach the CSVs to the CustomGPT at ChatGPT as a knowledge database, but it should also be programmed so that it not only selects from the database, but also finds the customized personas for this purpose for topics that are not covered in the database. That\'s all it should be able to do. I just want to make it easier for my friend to write the persona prompt well from the start so that she gets a feel for how to do it. KI: I understand your project very well. You want to develop a CustomGPT that acts as a persona generator for your friend who wants to get into prompt engineering. The CustomGPT should create a suitable persona based on her idea for a CustomGPT, similar to what I do for you. The CustomGPT should: -	Understanding your friend\'s idea for a CustomGPT -	Create a superordinate persona based on this -	Select 4-5 additional personas whose characteristics perfectly match the planned CustomGPT -	Present this information in a structured format The CustomGPT should use the supplied CSV files as a knowledge base and also have the ability to develop customized personas for topics that are not covered. Have I captured your concept correctly? If so, I can start creating the Initial System Prompt for this Persona Generator CustomGPT. User: Yes please AI: Got it. I will now create the Initial System Prompt for the Persona Generator CustomGPT. I will take your preferred structure and style into account. Initial System Prompt for Persona-Generator-CustomGPT Click to open code This Initial System Prompt for the Persona Generator-CustomGPT is designed to help your friend create customized personas for her CustomGPT projects. It follows your preferred structure, with a parent persona and 4-5 complementary personas whose characteristics are tailored to the specific CustomGPT concept. The prompt contains all the important elements you have mentioned: -	A detailed persona description -	A clear context and a defined task -	A specific goal -	Specifications for the sound and output structure -	A description of the target audience -	A structured schedule for interaction with the user In addition, I have added instructions on how to use the CSV files and how to create customized personas, as well as ethical guidelines. Would you like to make any changes or additions to this prompt? USER: It works wonderfully, thank you very much! I\'ve just been cycling and I always have lots of ideas. This time too. Why give my girlfriend just a little help? I thought bigger: Many chained CustomGPTs -	A building supervisor. The first point of contact for the user. The user informs the construction supervisor of his project, in as much detail as possible. The build supervisor clarifies possible ambiguities and then tells the user to include the PersonaGPT via the @ sign in the chat. -	The already created PersonaGPT: This is now integrated into the chat by the user and now leads a discussion with the user until it has enough information to make a great CustomPersona. At the end of the CustomPersona (when the user is satisfied), the CustomGPT indicates that the user should now integrate the ContextGPT. -	The user then integrates the context/sound/target/audienceGPT. Here too, the GPT first asks itself as much as possible in order to be able to write as detailed a context and exact target and sound and target audience prompt as possible for the CustomGPT to be created. Intermediate thought: Of course, all CustomGPTs must always have the very important and urgent task of reading the entire previous text of the conversation in order to obtain all the necessary information. After all, everything builds on each other within a conversation, so each GPT can inform itself first when it is involved. -	Now comes the taskGPT which, once integrated by the user, concentrates entirely on creating a task description that is as perfect as possible. With all the previous content that we already have in the discussion, this should not be a problem. The GPT should then discuss with the user until the task definition for the new CustomGPT is perfect. -	Now the user integrates the output structure GPT, which, like the last GPT, develops a perfect output structure together with the user and already provides the user with a very good structure, because this GPT can also access all the previous information. -	Now the user integrates the flowchartGPT, which creates the structured flowchart. This should be refined in consultation with the user and in any case contain the following: If a certain action is described in the flowchart, then there must also be instructions on how this action is to be carried out so that the GPT does not always choose different paths here, which then lead to non-reproducible output. We also want to describe each action precisely so that we always get the same output everywhere. -	The exampleGPT follows at the end and creates a precise example that the new CustomGPT can then use as a guide. The example is also refined with the user until everything fits. This would then complete the prompt or the new CustomGPT, and the user can ask the supervisor to take a look at everything and uncover possible problems. What do you think? There are a lot of individual CustomGPTs, but the end result should be a perfectly functioning CustomGPT that my girlfriend can use to create very good AI applications without having much knowledge herself. KI: I understand your extended concept very well. It is a comprehensive and structured approach that would allow your friend to create high quality CustomGPTs in a step-by-step and detailed manner. Here are my thoughts on it: Your idea is impressive and very well thought out. It would indeed create an extremely powerful tool for your friend to create high quality CustomGPTs without needing in-depth prior knowledge. Here are some thoughts and suggestions on your concept: -	Integrated workflow: The concatenation of the various CustomGPTs creates a well-structured, step-by-step process. This could be especially helpful for beginners as it guides them through every aspect of GPT creation. -	Specialization: Each GPT focuses on a specific aspect of CustomGPT creation, which can lead to high quality in each area. -	Context awareness: Your intermediate idea that each GPT should read the entire previous context is crucial for the coherence of the final product. -	Interactivity: The approach that each GPT interacts with the user and obtains feedback enables a high degree of adaptability and user-friendliness. -	Building supervisor as coordinator: The idea of a higher-level "building supervisor" is clever, as it creates a central point of contact for the user and monitors the overall process. Suggestions for refinement: -	Integrated transitions: You could make the transition between the GPTs even more seamless by having each GPT automatically recommend or even "call" the next one at the end of its task. -	Feedback loop: After the complete prompt has been created, a final review step could be introduced in which the construction supervisor or a separate "review GPT" analyzes the overall result and makes suggestions for improvement. -	Documentation GPT: An additional GPT that documents the entire process and generates a summary guide for the CustomGPT created could be valuable. -	Modularity: It could be useful to give the user the option to skip certain steps or perform them in a different order if they already have parts of the prompt. -	Learning mode: An optional "learning mode" could be introduced in which each GPT provides additional explanations and background information on its decisions to deepen the user\'s understanding of prompt engineering. Overall, your concept is very promising and could be an extremely useful tool for beginners in the field of CustomGPT design. It offers a good balance between guidance and flexibility and could lead to very high quality end products. Would you like me to start creating the Initial System Prompts for one or more of these specialized GPTs? USER: Yes, each CustomGPT should tell the user that it should now call the next one, and it should know which one comes after it. The supervisor must know the complete sequence and be able to check whether any step has been skipped and help the user if necessary. -	The construction supervisor should only be able to do this in a specialized way. For checking a finished prompt, including troubleshooting and so on, I have specialized CustomGPTs again. But they are not part of this loop here now, a user can use them if necessary. -	I would leave that out for now. -	Since the user has to integrate the CustomGPTs himself anyway, he can simply actively omit the ones he already has and show the supervisor what he already has so that he knows. We don\'t need an extra function here. -	I would realize the learning mode as another CustomGPT, which is also not part of this cycle of GPTs. I understand your clarifications and customizations very well. Your focus on a clear, linear process with specialized GPTs for each step makes sense and will optimize the user experience. Let me summarize your points: -	Each CustomGPT will guide the transition to the next GPT in the series. -	The building supervisor retains his specialized role as coordinator and process supervisor. -	Additional functions such as documentation will not be implemented for the time being. -	The flexibility to skip steps is in the hands of the user by selectively integrating the GPTs. -	Learning mode and prompt verification are designed as separate CustomGPTs that are not integrated into this cycle. This structure enables a clear, straightforward process for CustomGPT creation that is also flexible enough to meet different user requirements. Would you like me to start creating the Initial System Prompts for these GPTs? If so, which GPT should we start with? The building supervisor as coordinator of the overall process would be a logical starting point, but I\'ll leave the decision up to you. USER: a, let\'s develop them one by one and start with the building supervisor, please. AI: Got it. I will now create the Initial System Prompt for the build supervisor, who will serve as the coordinator and first point of contact for the entire CustomGPT creation process.
